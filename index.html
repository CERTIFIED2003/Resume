                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                As a developer, my journey has been a remarkable one, encompassing a vast array of experiences. From the
                humble beginnings of saving PowerPoint slides as HTML webpages to crafting intricate Full-Stack Web
                applications, I have embarked on a journey of constant learning and growth. With a passion for gaming, I
                have ventured into the exciting world of Video Game design, where I continue to explore and innovate.
                <br />
                Throughout my journey, I have come to appreciate the value of dedication and commitment. I firmly
                believe that with unwavering determination and an insatiable appetite for knowledge, we can learn
                something new every day. My parents have been a constant source of encouragement, providing the support
                and guidance that I needed to pursue my dreams. Alongside them, my brother-like friends have been an
                integral part of my journey, offering unwavering support and camaraderie.
                <br />
                With such incredible support, I am confident of a bright future filled with boundless opportunities. I
                look forward to continuing my journey of discovery, exploring new horizons and pushing the limits of
                what is possible.
